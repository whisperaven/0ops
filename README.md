# EXEd

**EXEd** is an api service which provide remote execute (including code release) on top of **exector plugins (e.g.: ansible/salt plugin)**

workdir | ansible | ansible work dir | ${cwd}
inventory | ansible | ansible inventory file/dir | inventory
playbooks | ansible | ansible playbooks dir | playbooks

# Run it:
```shell
$ bin/exed -c etc/exe.conf -d                                   # start the api server
$ celery worker -A exe.runner -l info --exe-conf etc/exe.conf   # start the celery worker
```

- Before you do that, you should have rabbitmq/redis server deployed.
- Make sure both api/worker can access rabbitmq and redis server.
- Make sure your ansible (including playbooks and inventory) was on the same machine with both api/worker.

- **role (required)** - String, the role/app to deploy on remote hosts.
- **partial** - String, only deploy things marked by this tag.
